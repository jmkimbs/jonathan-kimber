<h1>Project Works</h1>
<p>
	Project works? I sure hope it does! But in this area, that is not guaranteed... This section changes frequently and is intended to showcase projects that catch my fleeting interest. It may be a small experiment or proof of concept, or it may be something that later makes it to projects if I find myself engrossed and work on it regularly.
</p>

<p>
	If you know any new technologies worth checking out, or if you have any tips, tricks, or miscellaneous ideas about any of the technologies I am already using, please don't hesitate to send them my way!
